        <p>The
            <b>Faisal Mosque</b> is a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Islamabad.
            This mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by a Bedouin
            tent. This mosque is a major tourist attraction in Pakistan, Islamabad in particular, and is referred as a contemporary
            and influential feature of Islamic architecture. Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $120 million
            grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat
            Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a
            Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 feet tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping
            roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers. Combined the structure covers an area
            of 54,000 square ft, the mosque dominates the landscape of Islamabad. It is situated at the north end of Faisal
            Avenue, putting it at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla Hills, the westernmost foothills
            of the Himalayas</p>

        <p>The
            <b>Badshahi Masjid</b> is a Mughal era masjid in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab, Pakistan.
            The masjid is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely considered
            to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks. The Badshahi Masjid was built by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with
            construction of the masjid lasting for two years until 1673. The masjid is an important example of Mughal architecture,
            with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the largest masjid
            of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest masjid in Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the masjid
            was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.

            Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Designed in a 1960s modernist style, the mausoleum also contains
            the tomb of his sister, MƒÅder-e Millat Fatima Jinnah, and that of Liaquat Ali Khan and Nurul Amin, the first

            1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940 - the first
            official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation
            theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947.</p>
